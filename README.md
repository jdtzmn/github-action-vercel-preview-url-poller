# Vercel Preview URL with Status Polling GitHub Action

A reliable GitHub Action that retrieves Vercel preview deployment URLs and actively polls the deployment status until your Vercel preview environment is fully ready before proceeding with your CI/CD workflow.

## üöÄ Key Benefits

- **No Deployment Status Event Required**: Unlike traditional methods that rely on GitHub's `deployment_status` event, this action actively polls Vercel's API for real-time status updates. This means:

  - Works with any Vercel deployment workflow
  - No need to configure special deployment hooks
  - More reliable than webhook-based solutions
  - Can be used with both preview and production deployments
  - Compatible with custom deployment configurations

- **Prevent Flaky E2E Tests**: Ensures your end-to-end tests or integration tests don't run against partially-deployed Vercel previews
- **Reliable CI/CD Automation**: Only proceed when your Vercel preview deployment is actually ready to be used
- **Branch Alias Support**: Automatically get both the standard Vercel preview URL and branch alias URL (if configured)
- **Configurable Timeout Settings**: Set custom polling intervals and maximum wait times for deployment completion
- **Flexible Deployment Status Handling**: Define your own success/failure deployment states for custom workflows

## üîç How It Works

This GitHub Action performs three key operations in your CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Retrieves the latest Vercel deployment** for your project and branch using the Vercel API
2. **Extracts the preview URL and deployment ID** from the Vercel deployment data
3. **Polls the Vercel deployment status API** until the deployment reaches a ready state (or times out)

## üìã Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Pull Request Workflow

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Your Vercel deployment step here...

      - name: Get Vercel Preview URL and wait for deployment
        uses: RoyBkker/github-action-vercel-preview-url-poller@v1
        id: vercel_deployment
        with:
          vercel_token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel_project_id: "prj_your_project_id"
          max_timeout: 300 # 5 minutes max timeout
          polling_interval: 5 # Check deployment status every 5 seconds
          deployment_ready_states: "READY,CANCELED"
          deployment_error_states: "ERROR"

      - name: Run E2E tests against ready Vercel preview
        run: |
          # Now you can be confident the Vercel preview is fully deployed and ready
          echo "Vercel Preview URL: ${{ steps.vercel_deployment.outputs.preview_url }}"
          echo "Vercel Branch Alias: ${{ steps.vercel_deployment.outputs.branch_alias }}"

          # Run your E2E tests, Playwright tests, or Cypress tests here
          npm run test:e2e -- --baseUrl=${{ steps.vercel_deployment.outputs.preview_url }}
```

### Example 2: Multi-Project / Monorepo Production Testing Workflow

This example demonstrates how to use the action in a workflow that tests multiple applications in Vercel in a monorepo after deploying to production.

```yaml
name: Production Release Tests
description: Automated end-to-end and accessibility testing workflow for multiple applications after production deployments

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"
    paths:
      - "apps/**"

jobs:
  # Get URLs for the first application
  get-app1-production-url:
    timeout-minutes: 10
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      url: ${{ steps.production_url.outputs.preview_url }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Get app1 production URL
        id: production_url
        uses: RoyBkker/github-action-vercel-preview-url-poller@v1
        with:
          vercel_token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel_project_id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_APP1 }} # Only need for a different project id
          vercel_team_id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TEAM_ID }}
          max_timeout: 600 # 10 minutes max timeout for production builds
      - name: Display production URL
        run: echo "app1 production URL - https://${{ steps.production_url.outputs.preview_url }}"
        shell: bash

  # Get URLs for the second application
  get-app2-production-url:
    timeout-minutes: 10
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      url: ${{ steps.production_url.outputs.preview_url }}
